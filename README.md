LatinLookupTool
===============

The Online Latin Lookup Tool is an iOS app that, by using data from the Perseus Latin Word Tool, allows a user to lookup any Latin word, locate the stem, and parse the form completely. It gives all possible forms for the word. Ultimately, it is planned this tool will also link the stems to the online Lewis & Short dictionary from Perseus, and also from that dictionary, provide links to all the works in the Perseus database that are quoted in the dictionary.
